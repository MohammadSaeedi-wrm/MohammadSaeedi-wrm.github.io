Mohammad Saeedi is pursuing a doctoral degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Virginia, and his studies primarily revolve around applying hydrological variables and remote sensing to address and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. 
Mohammad Saeedi received a Master’s degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management (2021), and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. During his graduate course/thesis, he concentrated on employing soil moisture data in hydrological simulation and developing algorithms.
His applied research focuses on the following:<br/> 
(1) enhance the accuracy of the estimated variables in hydrological simulation, (2) predict natural disasters/extreme hydrological events, and (3) the exploitation of the above-mentioned in applied research to solve the major challenges associated with Earth science that is expected to be encountered in the coming decades. <br/>

## Research interests:

-	Soil moisture remote sensing
- Hydrological modeling
- Irrigation mapping and quantification using the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm
- Rainfall-runoff modelling using satellite soil moisture data
- Use of SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm, satellite and in situ observations for drought monitoring
- Spatial downscaling of satellite remotely sensed soil moisture
- Optimal convergence of model predictions with observations through data assimilation
- Data-Driven model and machine learning
