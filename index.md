I have received my M.Sc. degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management with a focus on remote sensing, hydrological modeling and algorithm development. I have received my B.Sc. in Civil Engineering. 
The main objective of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables, use practical research applications to improve the quality of data and satellite-based models to predict natural disasters and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. Therefore, in this way, a better understanding of the role played by environmental factors and hydrometeorological factors, to control and manage, in the face of the challenges ahead can be achieved.

## Research interests:

-	Soil moisture remote sensing
-	Hydrological modeling
-	Irrigation estimates from space using bottom-up approach
-	Runoff forecast using satellite soil moisture data
-	Drought monitoring using the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm, satellite data and in situ measurements
-	Spatial downscaling of satellite remotely sensed soil moisture
-	Optimal convergence of model predictions with observations through data assimilation
