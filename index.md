 Mohammad Saeedi received a Master’s degree in Water Resources Engineering and Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. During his graduate course/thesis, he concentrated on employing satellite remote sensing data in hydrological simulation and developing algorithms.
The main objective of his applied research is as follows:<br/> 
(1) enhance the accuracy of the estimated variables in hydrological simulation, (2) investigate data processing approaches to improving the quality of satellite- and model-based data, (3) predict natural disasters by utilizing remotely-sensed satellite data, and (4) the exploitation of the above mentioned to use in applied research to solve the significant challenges related to Earth science that we will face in the coming decades.
 

## Research interests:

-	Soil moisture remote sensing
-	Hydrological modeling
-	Irrigation estimates from space using bottom-up approach
-	Runoff forecast using satellite soil moisture data
-	Drought monitoring using the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm, satellite data and in situ measurements
-	Spatial downscaling of soil moisture remote sensing products
-	Optimal convergence of model predictions with observations through data assimilation
