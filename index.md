  I have received bachelor's and master's degrees in Civil Engineering and Water Resources Engineering and Management, respectively. During the My master's degree, I have been focussing on remote sensing, hydrological modeling and algorithm development.
  The main objective of my research is to provide accurate hydrological variables, using practical research applications to improve the quality of data satellite-based to predict natural disasters and solve the major challenges related to Earth science that we will face in the coming decades. Therefore, in this way, a better understanding of the impact of environmental factors and water and meteorological factors can be achieved for management in facing the challenges ahead.

## Research interests:

-	Soil moisture remote sensing
-	Hydrological modeling
-	Irrigation estimates from space using bottom-up approach
-	Runoff forecast using satellite soil moisture data
-	Drought monitoring using the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm, satellite data and in situ measurements
-	Spatial downscaling of soil moisture remote sensing products
-	Optimal convergence of model predictions with observations through data assimilation
