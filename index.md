Mohammad Saeedi is pursuing a doctoral degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Virginia, and his studies primarily revolve around applying hydrological variables and remote sensing to address and solve the major challenges related to Earth system science that we will face in the coming decades. 
Mohammad Saeedi received a Master’s degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management (2021), and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. During his graduate course/thesis, he concentrated on employing soil moisture data in hydrological simulation and developing algorithms.
His applied research focuses on the following:<br/> 
(1) enhance the accuracy of the estimated variables in hydrological simulation, (2) predict natural disasters/extreme hydrological events, and (3) the exploitation of the above-mentioned in applied research to solve the major challenges associated with Earth science that is expected to be encountered in the coming decades. <br/>
