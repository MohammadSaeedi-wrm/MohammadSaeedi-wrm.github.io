 Mohammad Saeedi received a Master’s degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management (2021), and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. During his graduate course/thesis, he concentrated on employing satellite remote sensing data in hydrological simulation and developing algorithms.
His applied research focuses on the following:<br/> 
(1) enhance the accuracy of the estimated variables in hydrological simulation, (2) investigate data processing approaches to improving the quality of satellite data, (3) predict natural disasters by utilizing remotely-sensed satellite data, and (4) the exploitation of the above-mentioned in applied research to solve the major challenges associated with Earth science that is expected to be encountered in the coming decades. <br/>
