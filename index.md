 Mohammad Saeedi received a Master’s degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management, and Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. During his graduate course/thesis, he concentrated on employing satellite remote sensing data in hydrological simulation and developing algorithms.
The main objective of his applied research is as follows:<br/> 
(1) enhance the accuracy of the estimated variables in hydrological simulation, (2) investigate data processing approaches to improving the quality of satellite data, (3) predict natural disasters by utilizing remotely-sensed satellite data, and (4) the exploitation of the above-mentioned in applied research to solve the major challenges associated with Earth science in the coming decades.
