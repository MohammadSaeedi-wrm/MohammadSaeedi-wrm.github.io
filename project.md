__[3] In situ measurement of soil moisture and its comparison with satellite- and model-based data (AMSR2, SMAP L3, SMAP L4 and GLDAS) in the Lake Urmia basin.__ `(2021)`

*(Note: Before this study, no in-situ measurement of soil moisture had been done in the surroundings of the Lake Urmia basin).*

	Which soil moisture satellite products are the best choice for other studies in Lake Urmia basin? 
	What is the performance of remotely sensed soil moisture products compared to in-situ measured soil moisture considering climate classification, soil texture and land cover categories?
