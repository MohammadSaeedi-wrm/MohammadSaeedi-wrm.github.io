__[2] SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating SM2RAIN and the analytical net water flux models.__ `(2020-2022)`
<br/> Using the net water flux analytical model presented by Sadeghi et al. (2019), the SM2RAIN model has been developed. The purpose of this developed algorithm (i.e. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422004437" style="color: blue;">SM2RAIN-NWF</a>) is to estimate rainfall through satellite soil moisture data as the only input using the integration of the SM2RAIN algorithm and the NWF model.

 <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> Is the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm capable of providing more accurate rainfall estimates than the SM2RAIN algorithm? <br/> <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> What is the difference between the performance of the two algorithms in estimating rainfall in different land covers?

__[1] In situ measurement of soil moisture and its comparison with satellite- and model-based data (AMSR2, SMAP L3, SMAP L4 and GLDAS) in the Lake Urmia basin.__ `(2019-2020)`
<br/> *(Note: Before this study, no in-situ measurement of soil moisture had been done in the surroundings of the Lake Urmia basin).* <br/> <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> Which soil moisture satellite products are the best choice for other studies in Lake Urmia basin? <br/> <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> What is the performance of remotely sensed soil moisture products compared to in-situ measured soil moisture considering climate classification, soil texture and land cover categories?
