## Curriculum Vitae

My research primarily focused on detecting best fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement moisture over the Lake Urmia basin. Then, I proceeded toward rainfall estimation using the satellite soil moisture data and generated a new algorithm using a bottom-up approach. <br/> SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the analytical net water flux model. <br/> Currently, I am focusing on improving the quality of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm, enhancing the accuracy of estimated rainfall, and expanding the applicability of this algorithm to cover various types of studies such as drought, runoff, irrigation, etc.
