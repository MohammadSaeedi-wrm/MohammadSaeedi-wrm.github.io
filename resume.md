## My Curriculum Vitae

I have received my M.Sc. degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management with a focus on remote sensing, hydrological modeling and algorithm development. I have received my B.Sc. in Civil Engineering.
My research primarily focused on detecting best fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement moisture over the Lake Urmia basin. Then, I toward rainfall estimation using the satellite soil moisture data and generated a new algorithm using a bottom-up approach. SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the analytical net water flux model. I am currently focusing on improving the quality of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm to provide more accurate rainfall, and improve the application of this algorithm in various studies such as drought, runoff, irrigation and etc.
