## Curriculum Vitae
My research primarily focused on detecting best-fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement moisture over the Lake Urmia basin. Then, I toward rainfall estimation using the satellite soil moisture data and generated a new algorithm using a bottom-up approach. SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the analytical net water flux model. 
I am currently focusing on improving the quality of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm to provide more accurate rainfall, and improve the application of this algorithm in various studies such as drought, runoff, irrigation and etc.
