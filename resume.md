## Curriculum Vitae

My research primarily focused on detecting best fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement moisture over the Lake Urmia basin. Then, I turned my attention to rainfall estimation using satellite soil moisture data and generated a new algorithm using a bottom-up approach. <br/> SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the analytical net water flux model. <br/>
__In order to address Earth's future challenges, I am currently exploring the application of numerical modeling, data science and machine learning algorithms to satellite remote sensing, water resources, and environmental sciences.__
