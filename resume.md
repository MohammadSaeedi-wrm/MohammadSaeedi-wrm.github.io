## Curriculum Vitae

I have received a B.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering, and I have received my M.Sc. degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management with a focus on remote sensing, hydrological modeling and algorithm development. 
My research primarily focused on detecting best fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement moisture over the Lake Urmia basin. Then, I toward rainfall estimation using the satellite soil moisture data and generated a new algorithm using a bottom-up approach. 
SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm and the analytical net water flux model. 
I am currently focusing on improving the quality of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm to provide more accurate rainfall, and improve the application of this algorithm in various studies such as drought, runoff, irrigation and etc.
